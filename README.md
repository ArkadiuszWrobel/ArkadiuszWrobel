## About me
Hello there! 👋 I'm Arkadiusz Wróbel and I've been immersed in the world of computers and IT since my early years. Exploring the intricacies of computers, software, and applications has always been my passion. What started as a love for gaming gradually evolved into a fascination with modding and testing.
Instead of just playing games, I found myself dedicating more time to testing and enhancing mod-packs I created. This shift sparked a realization that my true joy lies in the process of improving and refining, rather than solely playing.
Taking a break from my last job allowed me to dive deeper into the realm of software testing. Currently, I've completed two courses on Udemy, which have significantly enriched my knowledge and skills.

### **Skills & Interests:**

Software Testing: I've taken a deliberate step into the field of software testing, leveraging my natural curiosity and attention to detail to ensure the quality and reliability of software.

Modding Enthusiast: My gaming background transformed into a passion for modding. I enjoy the creative process of enhancing and customizing games to create unique and immersive experiences.    

Continuous Learning: I'm committed to personal and professional growth. The two Udemy courses I completed are just the beginning. I'm eager to explore new technologies and methodologies to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.

    
### **Future Goals:**

Expand Testing Skills: I'm actively seeking opportunities to further refine my testing skills, explore automation, and contribute to projects that emphasize quality.

Collaboration and Contribution: I'm open to collaborating with like-minded individuals and contributing to projects that align with my interests and expertise.
